# three-color-stepping

This project is described in: Three-color single-molecule imaging reveals conformational dynamics of dynein undergoing motility (2020) and can be found on BioRxiv.

Here, we provide the custom code that is used for the three-color acquisition of dynein stepping with uManager. Details on how the code works are given in the Methods section of the manuscript.
